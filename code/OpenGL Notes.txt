1 - Transform Feedback:
	Transform feedback allows the vertex shader to write the transformed geometry into a buffer
	object which can then be used by the CPU and be used again to render the transformed object
	saving the work of transforming the vertices twice.

	At first this seems to allow the recording of demos but we only need the transforms at a
	given time and the model itself.

	Could be used in collision calculations.

	Similar to a compute shader.

2 - Query Objects:
	Query the amount of samples that passed the depth test. In other words how many samples of
	a draw call are visible with the current transforms.
